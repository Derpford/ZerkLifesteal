# Zerk Lifesteal
A simple mod that does exactly one thing: Give you lifesteal when you're using a berserk pack.

## The Details
While your player has a PowerStrength item in their inventory, every time you do damage to something within a 128-unit radius, you heal 1 HP. It's That Simple[tm].

## Won't this also apply to the SSG?
It'll apply to any damage you do while zerked, as long as you're close enough to the target. Strictly speaking, you could run right into a crowd of zombies and fire a rocket-launcher point blank, and if you survive the initial blast, you might actually *gain* health from it.

This could be cheesable with things like the chaingun or chainsaw, but I'm okay with that. The whole point of doing this is to incentivize players to actually use berserk for the thing it was intended for: getting in there and being Too Angry To Die.
